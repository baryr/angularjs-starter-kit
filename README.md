# A starter kit for projects using the latest version of AngularJS

This project is an application skeleton playground (initial scaffolding or template) for a typical *modern* AngularJS web app.

This fork is based on [lackovic angularjs-starter-kit](https://github.com/lackovic/angularjs-starter-kit) with:
* bumped dependencies,
* bumped devDependencies,
* code rewritten to use ECMAScript Classes, Modules, Sass and WebPack build (with ng-annotate and babel)


## Features

* Latest version of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) (1.7.8);
* Node (v10.17.0);
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) for building (CLI version: 2.2.0, Local version: 4.0.2);
* Folders-by-Feature structure;
* Component-based design;
* [AngularUI Router](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/) for client-side routing;
* Data calls through services;
* ECMAScript 6 (arrow functions, strings interpolation, Classes, Modules);
* [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/);

## How to use

1. clone or download
2. `npm install`
3. Running with gulp: `gulp clean` and `gulp build_watch`
4. Running with npm scripts: `npm run-script build` and `npm start`
